The materials are free from any nuclear radioactive materials resulting from the Fukushima disaster. Some other suppliers have pendants made from materials sourced from this region as shown in YouTube videos with high Geiger counter readings, but our pendants have all been tested by Natures Energies using a Geiger counter to ensure they are free from such dangerous materials and below acceptable radiation limits. While these pendants do contain miniscule amounts of radioactive elements which naturally occur in volcanic materials. By wearing the Scalar Energy Pendant, you will effectively achieve the following benefits:-

        <p style="font-size:16px !important; margin:10px;color:#333;text-align:justify;color:#ffffff;">Detoxification foot pads are adhesive foot pads or patches that manufacturers claim can dramatically improve health when placed under the feet during sleep. Some of these pads may contain ingredients such as "distilled bamboo vinegar" that allegedly pull toxins from the body.With ageing, loss of the normal cushioning effect provided by the plantar fat pad is a common cause of foot pain. Although this occurs often in older people, it has multifactorial causes, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral vascular disease, trauma and chronic corticosteroid use. The loss of this protective adipose tissue and the surrounding collagen septae can expose the underlying delicate neurovascular structures to excess load and shear forces. In the compromised neuropathic foot often seen in people with diabetes, these excess forces can lead to break down of skin and ulceration exposing bony prominences.

        <p style="font-size:16px !important; margin:10px;color:#333;text-align:justify;color:#ffffff;">Noni juice is derived from the fruit of a small evergreen plant called noni, also known as Indian mulberry, normally found in global subtropics and tropics. Botanical name Morinda citrifolia, noni belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is privileged as the ‘queen’ of the Morinda genus owing to its conspicuous attributes, versatile nature, and distinctive capability of spreading itself usually on the seashores without requiring much human intervention. It is one of the earliest species which grow on the freshly deposited lava flows typically in Hawaiian regions. The historic beginning and geographic dissemination of noni juice in the Pacific islands trace back to thousands of years. Until the latter part of the twentieth century, noni plant was just used for dyeing clothes before its intriguing therapeutic value took its position at the forefront of alternative medication. Since then it has been admired as a focus of the Polynesian conventional medicine and is considered as a sacred healer among the Hawaiians for every plausible imbalance. In the recent years, juice of noni has been a part of discussions and speculations globally attributing to its unique healing characteristics, however, its true therapeutic potential is yet to be discovered. Noni tree is more like a shrub or small tree with its height ranging from 3-10 m. It has rounded branches, dark shiny leaves, reddish-brown seeds, and small groupings of edible white flowers which in due course progress into a few inches long, potato or egg-shaped greenish-white fruit carved with many round grooves.

    <p style="font-size:16px !important; margin:10px;color:#333;text-align:justify;color:#ffffff;">
        A solar lamp also known as solar light or solar lantern, is a lighting system composed of an LED lamp, solar panels, battery, charge controller and there may also be an inverter. The lamp operates on electricity from batteries, charged through the use of solar photovoltaic panel. Solar-powered household lighting can replace other light sources like candles or kerosene lamps. Solar lamps have a lower operating cost than kerosene lamps because renewable energy from the sun is free, unlike fuel. In addition, solar lamps produce no indoor air pollution unlike kerosene lamps. However, solar lamps generally have a higher initial cost, and are weather dependent. Solar lamps can be easier for customers to install and maintain as they do not require an electricity cable. Solar lamps can benefit owners with reduced maintenance cost and costs of electricity bills. Solar lamps can also be used in areas where there is no electrical grid or remote areas that lack a reliable electricity supply.There are many stories of people with lung disease, eye deterioration, burns and sometimes even death simply because they do not have a healthy alternative to light at night. Women have felt unsafe walking to the toilet outside after dark. Babies are being delivered by midwives using only a candle, and students cannot study when the sun goes down for lack of light leading to increased illiteracy and perpetual poverty. These are the realities for over 1 billion people around the globe. Lack of lighting equates to continued poverty felt around the world. Solar energy output is limited by weather and can be less effective if it is cloudy, wet, or winter.

Key Points: 1) Cell phones emit radiofrequency energy, a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, which can be absorbed by tissues closest to where the phone is held. 2) Studies thus far have shown a link between cell phone use and cancers of the brain, nerves, or other tissues of the head or neck. Cell phones emit radiofrequency energy (radio waves), a form of non-ionizing radiation. Tissues nearest to where the phone is held can absorb this energy. Ques) What is radiofrequency energy and how does it affect the body? RF energy is a form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). EMR can be categorized into two types: ionizing (e.g,x-rays) and non-ionizing (e.g,radiofrequency). Exposure to ionizing radiation, such as from radiation therapy, is known to increase the risk of cancer. However, although many studies have examined the potential health effects of non-ionizing radiation from radar, microwave ovens, and other sources. The ability of microwave ovens to heat food is one example of this effect of radio frequency energy. </p>
